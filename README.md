# MAUI Designer

A small project to be able to preview XAML changes into MAUI view, and later add drag and drop functionality to create MAUI UI.

## Current capabilities:
- Write XAML into the text editor, click on Render button, and corresponding view will be rendered in the frame.
- Select views from toolbox and perform drag+drop across the right side frame. Currently only supports AbsoluteLayout.
