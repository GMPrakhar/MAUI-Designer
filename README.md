# MAUI Designer

A small project to be able to preview XAML changes into MAUI view, and later add drag and drop functionality to create MAUI UI.

## Current capabilities:
- Write XAML into the text editor, click on Render button, and corresponding view will be rendered in the frame.
- Select views from toolbox and perform drag+drop across the right side frame. Currently only supports AbsoluteLayout.
- Scale the views using anchors on the border of the view.
- Properties menu for selected element so that the properties can be updated and applied directly to the view, including color, margin, padding and text/font manipulations.
- Generate XAML from the design, and load design from XAML. Currently only supports Absolute Layout as the base element ( after ContentPage ).
